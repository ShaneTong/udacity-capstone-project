video \"confession\" on a cell phone. the suspect blew himself up on wednesday as officers closed in to make an arrest. the video failed to reveal a coherent motive for the attacks. published 6 hours ago reuters source: sinclair broadcast group mark anthony conditt, suspect in the austin bombings scene on security video at a fedex facility. \\nthe serial bomber whose deadly attacks terrorized austin, texas, for weeks left a 25-minute video \"confession\" on a cell phone found after he blew himself up on wednesday as officers closed in to make an arrest, police said. \\nmark conditt, 23, an unemployed man from the suburb of pflugerville, detailed how he made all seven bombs that have been accounted for — five that exploded, one that was recovered before it went off and a seventh that he detonated as officers rushed his vehicle early on wednesday. \\nbut the video failed to reveal a coherent motive for the attacks spread over the past three weeks, police said. \\n\"he does not at all mention anything about terrorism, nor does he mention anything about hate, but instead it is the outcry of a very challenged young man, talking about challenges in his personal life,\" austin police chief brian manley told reporters. \\n\"i would classify this as a confession,\" manley said. \\nconditt, who had never before been in trouble with the law, killed two people and wounded five with a campaign of violence that began on march 2, authorities said. \\nbased on their search of the suspect\\'s home and his video statement, authorities said they felt confident that there were no other bombs and that the public was safe from further harm. \\nfbi special agent christopher combs said investigators believe the suspect would have continued his attacks had he not been apprehended. \\npolice recovered a \"target list\" of addresses for future bombings, the los angeles times reported, citing u.s. representative michael mccaul of texas, the republican chairman of the house homeland security committee. \\neven so, the video gave no explanation for the individuals and addresses singled out as recipients of the bombs that were planted or shipped, manley said. \\npolice previously said they had considered the possibility that the attacks were racially motivated, noting that the first several victims, including the two who died, were either african-american or hispanic. \\nconditt likely recorded the video between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. on tuesday. according to manley, conditt said he believed police \"were getting very close to him,\" and he was right. authorities filed a criminal complaint and issued an arrest warrant around that time. \\nby wednesday morning, police had tracked conditt to a hotel and were waiting for the arrival of tactical units and equipment before they planned to make an arrest, manley said. but then conditt drove away. \\npolice followed and decided to stop him before he got on the highway. just as officers approached the vehicle, the explosion went off, manley said. there was also some police shooting. \\n\"this can never be called a happy ending, but it\\'s a damn good one for the people of this community, the people of the state of texas,\" travis county district attorney margaret moore told reporters. \\nresidents in austin, a city of 1 million people and a liberal enclave of university students and tech companies, voiced relief that the hunt for the serial bomber was over. \\n\"i am going to be leery and extra careful tomorrow at work, but i feel relieved now,\" said jesus borjon, 44, an employee of parcel delivery firm ups, who lives in pflugerville. \\naustin was hosting thousands of out-of-town visitors for its annual south by southwest festival of music, film and technology when the first bombings occurred. trail of clues \\nthe trail of clues leading hundreds of investigators to the serial bomber ranged from store receipts and fragments of booby-trapped packages to surveillance video of the suspect in a hat and wig. \\nexperts scoured the suspect\\'s home for further evidence on wednesday, removing explosive materials and bomb components. \\n\"i wouldn\\'t call it a bomb-making factory, but there\\'s definitely components consistent with what we\\'ve seen in all these other devices,\" fred milanowski, special agent in charge of houston office of the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives, told reporters. \\ninvestigators evacuated a four-block radius around conditt\\'s house while they searched the home, which conditt shared with two roommates who had been detained for questioning. conditt moved in a year ago after leaving his parents\\' home about a mile (1.6 km) away, public records showed. \\none law enforcement official involved in the investigation but speaking on condition of anonymity told reuters that some of the materials found in remnants of the bombs were traced back to where they had been sold. \\nthe source also said investigators, once they had identified conditt as a potential suspect, obtained a warrant to monitor his google search history. \\nsurveillance video showed the suspect in a hat and a blond wig, as he prepared to ship one of two booby-trapped packages he was known to have sent through fedex corp\\'s delivery service, according to the source. \\nhe used the alias \"kelly killmore\" to ship those packages, abc news reported, citing unnamed law enforcement sources. \\nconditt, who was home-schooled, described himself as a conservative but said he was not politically inclined, according to blog posts he wrote as part of a u.s. politics class at austin community college. he attended from 2010 to 2012 and had no record of any disciplinary actions, the school said.',\n",

the suspended chief executive of cambridge analytica said in a secretly recorded video broadcast on tuesday that his uk-based political consultancy’s online campaign played a decisive role in   trump’s 2016 election victory. his comments, which could not be verified, are potentially a further problem for facebook inc as it faces lawmakers’ scrutiny in the united states and europe over cambridge analytica’s improper use of 50 million facebook users’ personal data. the social media network’s shares fell for a second day, closing down 2.5 percent to $168.15, as investors worried that its dealings with cambridge analytica might damage its reputation, deter advertisers and invite restrictive regulation. the company has lost $60 billion of its stock market value over the last two days. cambridge analytica said on tuesday its board of directors suspended ceo alexander nix, shortly before the second part of british broadcaster channel 4’s expose of the firm’s methods. in the program nix boasts he met trump when he was the republican presidential candidate “many times”. nix’s comments “do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation,” cambridge analytica said in a statement on tuesday. u.s. and european lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how cambridge analytica gained access to user data in 2014 and why facebook failed to inform its users, raising broader industry questions about consumer privacy. facebook said it had been told by the federal trade commission (ftc), the leading u.s. consumer regulator, that it would receive a letter this week with questions about the data acquired by cambridge analytica. it said it had no indication of a formal investigation. “the entire company is outraged we were deceived,” facebook said in a statement on tuesday. “we are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.” ftc review the ftc is reviewing whether facebook violated a 2011 consent decree it reached with the authority over its privacy practices, a person   told reuters. “we are aware of the issues that have been raised but cannot comment on whether we are investigating. we take any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously as we did in 2012 in a privacy case involving google,” an ftc spokesman said. under the 2011 settlement, facebook agreed to get user consent for certain changes to privacy settings as part of a settlement of federal charges that it deceived consumers and forced them to share more personal information than they intended, bloomberg reported. if the ftc finds facebook violated terms of the consent decree, it has the power to fine the company thousands of dollars a day per violation. in a research note, deutsche bank analysts said government scrutiny could hurt facebook’s ability to gather and deploy data for advertising targeting - critical to its growth. people walk past the building housing the offices of cambridge analytica in central london, britain, march 20, 2018. reuters/henry nicholls fear of regulation hurt other social media firms. shares of snap inc fell 2.5 percent and twitter inc fell more than 10 percent. facebook and its peers alphabet inc’s google and twitter already face a backlash over their role during the u.s. presidential election by allowing the spread of false information that might have swayed voters toward trump. u.s. senator dianne feinstein, the top democrat on the judiciary committee, called on tuesday for facebook ceo mark zuckerberg to testify in congress. congressional staff said the company would brief u.s. senate and house aides on wednesday. a congressional official said house intelligence committee democrats plan to interview cambridge analytica whistleblower christopher wylie. the committee interviewed nix by video teleconference, according to the congressional official, but a transcript of that interview has not yet been made public. slideshow (6 images) the senate intelligence committee, which is conducting a long-term investigation of alleged russian interference in u.s. politics and a detailed examination of u.s. election security precautions, would carry out its own inquiry of cambridge analytica, a congressional official with direct knowledge of the investigation said. the white house said it welcomed inquiries, and that the president believes that americans’ privacy should be protected. personal information in britain, the information commissioner’s office, an independent authority set up to uphold information rights in the public interest, was seeking a warrant from a judge to search the offices of london-based cambridge analytica. it was unclear late on tuesday whether it had obtained it. created in 2013, cambridge analytica markets itself as a source of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients. related coverage',\n",

the suspended chief executive of cambridge analytica said in a secretly recorded video broadcast on tuesday that his uk-based political consultancy’s online campaign played a decisive role in   trump’s 2016 election victory. his comments, which could not be verified, are potentially a further problem for facebook inc as it faces lawmakers’ scrutiny in the united states and europe over cambridge analytica’s improper use of 50 million facebook users’ personal data. the social media network’s shares fell for a second day, closing down 2.5 percent to $168.15, as investors worried that its dealings with cambridge analytica might damage its reputation, deter advertisers and invite restrictive regulation. the company has lost $60 billion of its stock market value over the last two days. cambridge analytica said on tuesday its board of directors suspended ceo alexander nix, shortly before the second part of british broadcaster channel 4’s expose of the firm’s methods. in the program nix boasts he met trump when he was the republican presidential candidate “many times”. nix’s comments “do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation,” cambridge analytica said in a statement on tuesday. u.s. and european lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how cambridge analytica gained access to user data in 2014 and why facebook failed to inform its users, raising broader industry questions about consumer privacy. facebook said it had been told by the federal trade commission (ftc), the leading u.s. consumer regulator, that it would receive a letter this week with questions about the data acquired by cambridge analytica. it said it had no indication of a formal investigation. “the entire company is outraged we were deceived,” facebook said in a statement on tuesday. “we are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.” ftc review the ftc is reviewing whether facebook violated a 2011 consent decree it reached with the authority over its privacy practices, a person   told reuters. “we are aware of the issues that have been raised but cannot comment on whether we are investigating. we take any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously as we did in 2012 in a privacy case involving google,” an ftc spokesman said. under the 2011 settlement, facebook agreed to get user consent for certain changes to privacy settings as part of a settlement of federal charges that it deceived consumers and forced them to share more personal information than they intended, bloomberg reported. if the ftc finds facebook violated terms of the consent decree, it has the power to fine the company thousands of dollars a day per violation. in a research note, deutsche bank analysts said government scrutiny could hurt facebook’s ability to gather and deploy data for advertising targeting - critical to its growth. people walk past the building housing the offices of cambridge analytica in central london, britain, march 20, 2018. reuters/henry nicholls fear of regulation hurt other social media firms. shares of snap inc fell 2.5 percent and twitter inc fell more than 10 percent. facebook and its peers alphabet inc’s google and twitter already face a backlash over their role during the u.s. presidential election by allowing the spread of false information that might have swayed voters toward trump. u.s. senator dianne feinstein, the top democrat on the judiciary committee, called on tuesday for facebook ceo mark zuckerberg to testify in congress. congressional staff said the company would brief u.s. senate and house aides on wednesday. a congressional official said house intelligence committee democrats plan to interview cambridge analytica whistleblower christopher wylie. the committee interviewed nix by video teleconference, according to the congressional official, but a transcript of that interview has not yet been made public. slideshow (6 images) the senate intelligence committee, which is conducting a long-term investigation of alleged russian interference in u.s. politics and a detailed examination of u.s. election security precautions, would carry out its own inquiry of cambridge analytica, a congressional official with direct knowledge of the investigation said. the white house said it welcomed inquiries, and that the president believes that americans’ privacy should be protected. personal information in britain, the information commissioner’s office, an independent authority set up to uphold information rights in the public interest, was seeking a warrant from a judge to search the offices of london-based cambridge analytica. it was unclear late on tuesday whether it had obtained it. created in 2013, cambridge analytica markets itself as a source of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients. related coverage',\n",

the suspended chief executive of cambridge analytica said in a secretly recorded video broadcast on tuesday that his uk-based political consultancy’s online campaign played a decisive role in   trump’s 2016 election victory. his comments, which could not be verified, are potentially a further problem for facebook inc as it faces lawmakers’ scrutiny in the united states and europe over cambridge analytica’s improper use of 50 million facebook users’ personal data. the social media network’s shares fell for a second day, closing down 2.5 percent to $168.15, as investors worried that its dealings with cambridge analytica might damage its reputation, deter advertisers and invite restrictive regulation. the company has lost $60 billion of its stock market value over the last two days. cambridge analytica said on tuesday its board of directors suspended ceo alexander nix, shortly before the second part of british broadcaster channel 4’s expose of the firm’s methods. in the program nix boasts he met trump when he was the republican presidential candidate “many times”. nix’s comments “do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation,” cambridge analytica said in a statement on tuesday. u.s. and european lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how cambridge analytica gained access to user data in 2014 and why facebook failed to inform its users, raising broader industry questions about consumer privacy. facebook said it had been told by the federal trade commission (ftc), the leading u.s. consumer regulator, that it would receive a letter this week with questions about the data acquired by cambridge analytica. it said it had no indication of a formal investigation. “the entire company is outraged we were deceived,” facebook said in a statement on tuesday. “we are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.” ftc review the ftc is reviewing whether facebook violated a 2011 consent decree it reached with the authority over its privacy practices, a person   told reuters. “we are aware of the issues that have been raised but cannot comment on whether we are investigating. we take any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously as we did in 2012 in a privacy case involving google,” an ftc spokesman said. under the 2011 settlement, facebook agreed to get user consent for certain changes to privacy settings as part of a settlement of federal charges that it deceived consumers and forced them to share more personal information than they intended, bloomberg reported. if the ftc finds facebook violated terms of the consent decree, it has the power to fine the company thousands of dollars a day per violation. in a research note, deutsche bank analysts said government scrutiny could hurt facebook’s ability to gather and deploy data for advertising targeting - critical to its growth. people walk past the building housing the offices of cambridge analytica in central london, britain, march 20, 2018. reuters/henry nicholls fear of regulation hurt other social media firms. shares of snap inc fell 2.5 percent and twitter inc fell more than 10 percent. facebook and its peers alphabet inc’s google and twitter already face a backlash over their role during the u.s. presidential election by allowing the spread of false information that might have swayed voters toward trump. u.s. senator dianne feinstein, the top democrat on the judiciary committee, called on tuesday for facebook ceo mark zuckerberg to testify in congress. congressional staff said the company would brief u.s. senate and house aides on wednesday. a congressional official said house intelligence committee democrats plan to interview cambridge analytica whistleblower christopher wylie. the committee interviewed nix by video teleconference, according to the congressional official, but a transcript of that interview has not yet been made public. slideshow (6 images) the senate intelligence committee, which is conducting a long-term investigation of alleged russian interference in u.s. politics and a detailed examination of u.s. election security precautions, would carry out its own inquiry of cambridge analytica, a congressional official with direct knowledge of the investigation said. the white house said it welcomed inquiries, and that the president believes that americans’ privacy should be protected. personal information in britain, the information commissioner’s office, an independent authority set up to uphold information rights in the public interest, was seeking a warrant from a judge to search the offices of london-based cambridge analytica. it was unclear late on tuesday whether it had obtained it. created in 2013, cambridge analytica markets itself as a source of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients. related coverage',\n",
